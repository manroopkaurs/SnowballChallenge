        <h1>Our Idea</h1>
        <p> We notice that a lot of people struggle to find jobs, and especially when there are hundred of
          differnt websites where people can publish jobs. Some companies have their own websites, and others use programs
          such as LinkedIn to publish their jobs. Eventhough these are very good options to publish a job ad, we still find
          it tricky for some people to find the jobs they belong to, or fit into.
          <br>
          This is why we decided to start <strong><em>Your Future</em></strong>, a website that collects information from different job publishing
          websites and presents them all together. This will make it easier for the job searchers to quiickly find a job that fits them,
          and also make it easier in general for emplyers and employees too connect.
          <br>
          The website will also make it easy for anyone to apply to a job, as it has its own appilcation system. The user creates a CV
          and a job appilcation which will be saved under their account. When they decide to apply for a job, they can sign into their account,
          and choose "Apply now" under the jobs.
          <br>
          The website will only be avaiable for actual jobs, and by that we mean jobs that are legal and also apporved by the government in
          different countries. The employers who post their ads, have to present proof of their job being legal before they can proceed. The safety of
          user is also an important factor, which is why no one, but the employer that has recieved the job application, will have acess to the applicants
          information.

              <p> We are two girls, Manroop Kaur and Priti Singh, who are studying computer science at OsloMet. We decided that this solution would be the most easiest and most benefitial
              to track student attendance. For now we are focusing mainly on the attendance in Ethiopia, but we know that this system can be used globally as well.</p>
